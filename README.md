## Features:
- **Promotional Carousel**
  The homepage features a dynamic Promotional Carousel that continuously scrolls:
  - *Spend over Â£95 for free delivery*
  - *Click & Collect Available*
  - *Contact phone number for making direct contact*
&nbsp;
- **Home**.
  The homepage acts as the landing page and also the gallery that showcases the cake styles available, all of which are separated into categories of Wedding, Birthday and Novelty so that a user can easily find what they're looking for, but not without having a cursory glance at the variety available, as each cake image is accompanied by the cake name, a short excerpt describing the cake which acts as a link to the detail page of that cake.
  With clear navigation at the top, leading to other parts of the site, including a link for admins of the site to go straight to the django admin panel, a user is able to find their way about, easily.
&nbsp;
- **Cake Detail Page**
Once a user selects a cake from our homepage gallery, they are taken to a detailed page dedicated to that cake. The detail page offers an in-depth look at the cake, including larger clear images, a comprehensive description, pricing, and keys to make clear when a cake is plant based or gluten free. Users can also find customer reviews here, giving insights from others who have chosen this cake for their celebrations. With a focus on simplicity, the page provides an easy path to order the cake, ask questions, or return to the gallery for further browsing.

  
&nbsp;
- **Registration/Sign-In/Sign-Out**: User authentication is managed using Allauth, ensuring a smooth registration, login, and logout process.
&nbsp;
- **Customer Profile Management**: Whilst user's profiles are automatically created upon registration, they are in essence blank other than their user name.  Further to this, users can fully create, update, and delete their profiles on the site.
&nbsp;
- **Admin Capabilities**: Admins can easily add cake data, including images 
  and details, via the Django admin panel. Here, admins are able to create new categories, flavours, descriptions and update prices.

### Table for planning Cakes database models

Defining type:Wedding, Novelty and Birthday. Allergy: GF for Gluten Free. V for plantbased.  Flavours and colors. And a list of the cakes themselves, making them searchable by users of the site when such extra functionality added.

Using Normalization to organize the data, so when changes to the data is required, it's more easily managed.
In doing so, new content for the fields can be created by a site administrator.  The new content being cake names, descriptions and additional categories if the so wish.

The purpose of the tables when planning the structure of the data was not to reflect the exact details of each cake currently available, but instead have the relevant sections.  So whilst I've used some of the names of cakes and data such as gluten free, etc...  The precise details of cakes on the site is subject to change, which was the purpose of the field structure.

## Development Approach
The Just Cakes project, at this stage is simple.  And the functionality could have been more condensed/streamlined.  But I'm purposely spread it out across applications within the main project.  My intention was to keep it structured in a manner that allowed me to add more features further down the line.  With this in mind, I previously had other apps such as "orders" which whilst not being utilized at this point, I did have fields such as account_number,  payment_method, purchase_order_date, delivery_order_date and basket_item_count which would have contributed to this wider functionality. As few as these extra lines of code were sitting latently as they did, demanded that I add a fair amount of comments around them in order to explain their presence, which resulted in an excessive amount of commenting which in turn detracted from the functional code which was more important.  I decided that removing it and inserting it at a later date was the lesser of the two evils, given that the functional code was the important part for assessment.  Not the provisional code for what the functions might do in the future.

- **Decision to use Function Based Views vs Class Based Views**
As I've been developing this project, I've used both function based views and class based views. Initially I had a preference to class based because it's what was shown in the walk throughs, so it was "familiar".  But as I've progressed, I found myself less reliant on patterns of usage that I had learned.  And instead I found myself leaning toward function based views because I found them to be clearer to "me", for what I was wanting to do.  The `models.py` in each application have remained class based because it's more suited to django. Doubtless, as I progress, my need will change. I'll probably move back and forth between classes and functions according to the complexity of tasks or indeed which seems to suit better, as I myself progress in my learning.
&nbsp;
**Since first writing the above**, this has indeed changed.  When adding the facility to comment and considering the facility to update posts, I've chosen to change more toward class based views.  This has been important because this project has is condensed into only three apps which makes for a lot of things in one space, making the code quite hard to read.
Using Classes makes for cleaner more structured and easier to follow structures.
&nbsp;
- **Use of Environment Variables**
I've used an environment variable to control the DEBUG setting, so that it sets to True when I'm working on development of of the application and then to False when it runs in the deployed production mode.  This ensures security in production and detailed error messages in development.  The idea and code was copied from my walkthrough projects with code institute.

## Development Challenges & Solutions.
During the development of *Just Cakes*, I encountered a number of issues. These are some of the notable ones and the solutions I found...

### Renaming for Clarity and Relevance
- **Reviews / Posts**
Initially, I was following the structure of the walkthrough project which consisted of only one application that handled all the functions of posting, commenting, liking etc...  Aware that the scope for growth would make the application crowded, I decided to follow the design principle "Separation of Concerns".  In doing so, I created individual apps to manage the functions.
The Unused applications which I've spoken about, aside, I had separate apps for the customer accounts, the database of cakes and the app that handled to posts.
Initially attempting to adopt the tutorial's naming conventions led to some confusion, particularly with the "reviews" app, which was too narrowly defined and not entirely reflective of its broader purpose in the context of the site.
Add to this, I was struggling with correctly applying singular and plural usage of the words "review/reviews" when naming the files.
**Resolved** I was unsure of how much disruption would have been caused by changing the application's name, so I decided to leave it as "reviews" but chose to change the html files within the application to "post" and "posts" which were more relevant.
&nbsp;
- **The Index.html**
Another issue that only became apparent later was that in my need to name the html pages according to the applications that they belonged to, I lost focus of keeping index.html as a central point.
The purpose of the site was to showcase their cakes, so I decided to make the gallery view of the cakes the landing page and changed the cakes_list.html to index.html
&nbsp;
- **Customer Accounts versus Customer Profiles**
Not being definitive about customer accounts or customer profiles, the boundaries between the two were blurred, even impacting the logic of what things did.  It was only after a mass-renaming of files that I was able to separate things which resulted in having better logic of how templates where connected to one another and also the logic of what they displayed in relation to one another.
&nbsp;
- **Truncated Excerpts** When looking at why excerpts of posts weren't dynamically displaying, I realised that I had fields for "content" and a field literally called "excerpt".  I had been double thinking this and they were attempting to serve the same purpose.  Unfortunately thinking of the word "excerpt" I kept focus on that and used it when trying to serve it up dynamically.  But it was the content fields that was saving the data.  When realising this, I dropped "excerpt" from the post model and used "content correctly".
I then went about creating new content for the posts so that the posts each had a reasonable number of words before I could make use of truncating down to 25 words.  So I copy pasted generic text in via the admin panel, attributing it to various users.
However... Upon rendering the screen the copy and pasting had taken html styles across and although it didn't show when entering in via the admin panel, it did show in the render.
I tried to clean the output by using ```{{ post.content|striptags }}``` and that did work, but not with truncation, so I decided to not bother with the striptags command on the bases that users would normally be entering text a fresh and this issue is unlikely to arise.
  

### Deployment & Static files
  To simplify things to a level where I had less to look at I once again removed the environmental variables that controlled DEBUG and ALLOWED_HOSTS and hardcoded these into the django settings file.
  The ongoing issue was finally resolved when I tried to manually disable the collect static by logging into Heroku via my console and using:
  `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=0` which gave me a return saying that it couldn't find the app.
  Somehow heroku was referencing an application that had previously been deleted.
  Explicitly specifying the app name with:
  `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=0 --app just-cakes` seemed to break this link, solved the situation and enabled me to replace the hardcoded settings with the environmental variables.



- **Authenticated Users vs Customer account.**
  Initially having this set to ensure that whenever a user registered, hence becoming an "authenticated" user, a customer account/profile was created.  This also worked in reverse in that if a user where to delete their profile, their corresponding account in the customer_accounts application would also be deleted and the user would then be redirected to the sign-up page.

- **Code Validation**
  During the validation process using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), I received informational messages stating ```Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values.``` and was advised to remove them.  I did attempt to do this but as soon as I would hit "save", these would return.  I attempted to change this default behavior by from my IDE by going into my settings, but was unable to find how to change it.
  
  
  One such message was regarding trailing slashes on void elements, which have no effect and may interact badly with unquoted attribute values.

## Agile Development Process

### User Stories

These are a few key user stories that guided the development of *Just Cakes:*

- As a Site User, I can browse a selection of cakes so that I can choose one I like.
- As a Site User, I can like and unlike reviews so that I can show if I found them helpful

- As a Admin, I can search posts using filters such as titles and when the posts were written so that I'm able to find the posts I'm looking for, quicker and more efficiently

For a complete list of user stories, see [My Project Board](https://github.com/users/CheyenneMDavid/projects/30).

### Clashes between package extensions.
Initially installing linters and formatters to ensure code quality and consistency.  But as I tried different extensions, after a while this seemed to cause more issues and I was unable to workout what was clashing with what.  So I separated things into a requirements.txt for the stuff that the project was dependant on, in order to run and the stuff that was useful during development was placed in requirements-dev.txt after reading this article: https://realpython.com/lessons/production-vs-development-dependencies/. In the search for way to stop things clashing I eventually came across the term "virtual environment" which people seemed to mention quite a lot on slack.
I eventually did away with the requirements-dev.txt file and setup a virtual environment and installed only the packages I wanted.

### Other issues encountered during development

- **Fork to solve Database Schema and `models.py` Issues**
In the back and forth with the clashing of extensions, At some point the Database Schema and the `models.py` in the customer_accounts app didn't match up.  On one hand I was getting errors saying that the first_name, last_name and memorable_dates weren't recognized after I had added and migrated them.  On the other hand I couldn't migrate them again because I was told that there were no changes detected.  I tried editing the migration files and finally deleted them in the hope of creating fresh migrations, but seemed to come full circle.  Eventually, creating a new database instance which seemed a cleaner way to go forward.
&nbsp;
- **Database Issue**
  When adding functionality to the reviews app, for users to delete their comments, I had a lot of issues with migrating the changes.  Changes weren't showing so couldn't be migrated and it was crashing as it was. Looking to resolve this, I removed the migration files in the hope that changes would be recognised to no avail. Unable to see a way forward I resorted to flushing the database. Even this was still giving me a message that said no changes had been made.
  So I eventually just deleted the database instance at ElephantSQL, created another and re-entered everything again.
  This left me with a lot of files that I had yet to commit, mostly migration ones.  So they were committed in bulk to clear the clutter.
  &nbsp;
  **New Site**
  I was unable to get my svg pattern which I was using as wallpaper to display.  I thought that this was due to the fact that I hadn't set the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC in Heroku and after deploying once with it not set, I couldn't seem to simply set it on the deployments there after.  After numerous attempts to get round this which included trying  to use Whitenoise to serve the static files, I eventually reverted to Cloudinary settings for them.  After numerous re-runs and re-dos I can see that it's not the static file that is the issue because the other styling is present.  The SVG pattern is not.  It's not interfering with the functioning so this can me addressed at a later date.

### Manual Testing

#### Test to ensure that a default image is displayed if an image isn't supplied from the Django admin panel or if they are deleted.

**Method**
I tested this by creating a default image which was placed in Cloudinary.  After which I used the admin panel to save cake images, tying them up with the individual cake data, also added via the admin panel.
I then systematically deleted one  from each category from the admin panel.

**Result** -- **Pass**
The screen was rendered using the default images as they should.
Screenshots of default images displaying:
- **Wedding**

## Further Development

Just Cakes is more the business name.  The application's aim is to create and hold accounts, ability to order/buy online.  Further development would be to add a "delivery application" which would tie in with other applications within the over all , holding many of their bits of information as foreign keys in it's own model.

It's because I plan to develop these aspects, I've purposely kept things quite separate.  So that when it's further developed, as aspects of it expand, they won't impinge on one another.  Hence, apparently redundant code such as
