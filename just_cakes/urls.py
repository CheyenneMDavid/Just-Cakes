# Much in this file is from the walkthrough project with Hello Django
# Had to change names defining singular and plural to make more sense, both
# here and in other places throughout files.
# Also, have changed "review" to "post" for consistency and to fit with how
# django handles things.


# Importing required modules
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

# URL patterns for overall project.
urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("summernote/", include("django_summernote.urls")),
    path("", include("post.urls")),
    path("account/", include("allauth.urls")),
